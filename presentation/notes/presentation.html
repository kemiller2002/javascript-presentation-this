                    <li>What does this really mean in JS</li>
                    <li>C#, etc. have similar conventions, but they are applied differently</li>
                    <li><strong>this</strong> is about the parent like other languages, 
                        but functions are fluid - they can change parents</li>
                    <li>This is because JavaScript has prototype inheritance, or instance based programming.
                            <ul>
                                <li>This most likey came from it's origins of LISP</li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Even through JavaScript has classes, it's still a prototype based language and so we need to pay attention to how it functions, because of integration with other modules.</strong></li>
